Kinematic Calibration

Automatic calibration algorithm to determine the kinematic model of any serial manipulator. A method based on circle fitting and dual vector geometry is included to determine the Classic Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for a serial manipulator.

It requires a CSV file for each actuated joint. This file should contain the acquired end-effector positions of the robot as each joint is separately moved.
